A set of tools used to wrap around funcaptcha &amp; directly access their API
Built on .NET Framework v4.7.2

NOTE: I am not proud of this code. It is pretty bad

DISCLAIMER:
I am not responsible for whatever anybody does with this, this is simply a set of tools used to easily & seamlessly interact with FunCaptcha
for an easier & better experience and integration into user applications. It is against the Funcaptcha Terms of Service to automate the solving
process & I do not promote doing that. The sole purpose of this framework is to provide an easy access to the API for easy integration into applications that are not web browsers.
