DISCLAIMER:
I am not responsible for whatever anybody does with this, this is simply a set of tools used to easily & seamlessly interact with FunCaptcha
for an easier & better experience and integration into user applications. It is against the Funcaptcha Terms of Service to automate the solving
process & I do not promote doing that.
